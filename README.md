# The Exocortex (2130)

The exocortex provides a scalable means of extending cognition in the cloud.

## Neocortex

We have approximately 15 billion neurons in the neocortex (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/).

## Linking networks of thought

There are now 8 billion humans on Earth, meaning that we have indirect access to over 1.2 x 10^20 neurons. The exocortex is designed to provide a feature-rich interface for your brain to access a personalized thought tree of 2 trillion neurons. If we map all human knowledge as of 2024, we'll need roughly 60 million exocortexes.
